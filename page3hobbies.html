		<h2> Sports </h2> 
		<p> Growing up, I have always played sports. When I was growing up I was immensly involved in baseball in my town. I spent around half the year on the baseball diamond in my youth. Now, however, I do not play baseball anymore, but am a thrower for track and field, and have been doing so ever since my sophmore year. </p>

		<h2> Dirtbikes </h2>
		<p> As if there aren't already enough pictures already of them in my website, it is easy to tell that I love Dirtbikes. One twist of the throttle and I'm off. To me there is no greater pleasure then to hit the max gear, at the max speed on a dry lake bed of openness.  . </p>

	<div class="column">
		<h2> Drones </h2>
		<p> Ever since about when I was twelve years old, I have flown many drones and continue to today as they are extremely fun. As well, I have earned my FAA certification of an unmanned aircraft systems certification, in which I have become a professional operator of drones. </p>
