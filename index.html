		   <h2> Early Life </h2> 
		   <p> I spent most of my childhood playing baseball and riding dirtbikes. I was infatuated with helicopters and airplanes and firetrucks. </p>

	   <div class="column" 
		<h2 Me Now </h2>
		 <p> Currently I still ride dirtbikes quite frequently however I throw for track and field in the events of shotput and discus. I am 17 years old and drive a 2000 ford excursion (that's also 4x4 and diesel). I enjoy passing time by going on my personal computer at home and flying drones and working on electronics. </p>

		<h2> Future Me </h2> 
		 <p> In the future I aim to become a helcopter pilot and major in computer science. I also plan to do something professional (although I don't know what) with my FAA certification of an unmanned aircraft systems certification. </p>
